# Bookstore-Management-System-SQL-Tableau
This repository is for final project of Database Management and Database Design subject. The project consists of a Bookstore management relational database and various operations on this database covering basic to advanced SQL topics.

PROPOSED BUSINESS SOLUTION
The proposed Bookstore Inventory Management System is an Online Book Shop which has the database of all the available books for purchase. A customer can search for a book he/she wants to purchase based on the title, author or language of the book and place an order through the system. The shop staff will deliver the book to the respective customer. An order will be placed once the customer does a checkout. Also, only the books which are available in the store will be present in the database. The online book shop owner can delete the books or change the availability according to his inventory. Therefore, this model provides efficient management of inventory in the bookstore and can also help in increase of business by automating certain operations.
